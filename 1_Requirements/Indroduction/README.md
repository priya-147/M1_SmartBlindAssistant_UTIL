# ABSTRACT

 * Our project presents a theoretical model and a system concept to 
provide a smart electronic aid for blind people. The system is intended to provide 
overall measures- like Artificial vision and object detection. The aim of the overall 
system is to provide a low cost and efficient navigation aid for blind which gives a 
sense of artificial vision by providing information about the environmental scenario 
of objects. An Ultrasonic sensor is used to calculate distance of the objects(Tree or 
lamp post, pit, obstacles, pavement up, pavement down)around the blind person to 
guide the user towards the available path.

 * Output is in the form of displaying the distance in the LCD and the buzzer which 
the blind person can hear.

 * Currently, various instruments are invented to help the visually blind people by 
many methods. Our project helps to improve the strength of the people by automatic 
navigation. By wearing this aid, they can face any obstacles without any fear. In the 
yearly projects, many of them used infrared sensor, but in this project we use 
ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance. Our aim is to provide an efficient 
instrument to blind people. It leads to good results in detecting the obstacles, 
wherever the blind is. Wearing an aid is more convenient than carrying a stick 
wherever they go.
