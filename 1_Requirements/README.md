# Introduction
 This project presents a theoretical model and a system concept to 
provide a smart electronic aid for blind people. The system is intended to provide 
overall measures- like Artificial vision and object detection. The aim of the overall 
system is to provide a low cost and efficient navigation aid for blind which gives a 
sense of artificial vision by providing information about the environmental scenario 
of objects.Currently, various instruments are invented to help the visually blind people by 
many methods. This project helps to improve the strength of the people by automatic 
navigation. By wearing this aid, they can face any obstacles without any fear.Visually impaired people are the people who can't identify smallest 
detail with healthy eyes. Those who have the visual acuity of 6/60 or the horizontal 
extent of the visual field with both eyes open less than or equal to 20 degrees, these 
people are considered blind . Such people are in need of aiding devices for blindness 
related disabilities. As described in 10% of blind have no usable eyesight at all to 
help them move around independently and safely. The electronic aiding devices are 
designed to solve such issue. wherever they go.
  
# Requirements 

## High Level Requirements

   * Provide a efficient instrument for  blind people.
   * It contains the costs and details of all the products.
   * Wearing an aid is more convenient than carrying a stick.
    
  
## Low Level Requirements

   * low cost and efficient navigation aid.
   * Any obstacle Can be  detected.
   * The electronic aiding devices are designed independently and safely.
   * Obstacles  are transmitted by the wave and reception of reflected waves.
