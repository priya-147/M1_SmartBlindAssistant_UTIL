 ## INTRODUCTION
* Visually impaired people are the people who can't identify smallest 
detail with healthy eyes. Those who have the visual acuity of 6/60 or the horizontal 
extent of the visual field with both eyes open less than or equal to 20 degrees, these 
people are considered blind . Such people are in need of aiding devices for blindness 
related disabilities. As described in 10% of blind have no usable eyesight at all to 
help them move around independently and safely. The electronic aiding devices are 
designed to solve such issue. 


* To record information about the obstacles presence in a road, active 
or passive sensors can be used. In case of a passive sensor, the sensor just receives 
a signal. It detects the reflected, emitted or transmitted electro-magnetic radiation 
provided by natural energy sources. In case of using an active sensor, the sensor 
emits a signal and receives a distorted version of the reflected signal. It detects 
reflected responses from objects irradiated with artificially generated energy 
sources. These kind of active sensors are capable of sensing and detecting far and 
near obstacles. In addition, it determines an accurate measurement of the distance 
between the blind and the obstacle. Overall, in the obstacle detection domain, four 
different types of active sensors may be used: infrared, laser, ultrasonic, in addition 
to radar sensors. 


 * Smart Cane, Smart vision, Guide Cane, use ultrasonic sensors or 
laser sensors to detect obstacles in front of blind by transmitting the wave 
and reception of reflected waves. It produces either an audio or vibration in 
response to detected obstacles to warn blind. Systems voice use single camera or 
stereo video cameras mounted on a wearable device to capture images. These 
captured images are re-sized, processed further and converted to speech, audio, 
musical sounds or vibrations. In such systems, the frequency of warning sound 
signal is correlated with the orientation of pixels. Some advanced systems use 
Global Positioning System (GPS) integration with the mainsystem. It's also 
noteworthy that GPS receiver is useful for understanding the current location of the 
subject and nearby landmarks.
