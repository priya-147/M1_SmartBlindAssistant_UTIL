 # MODELLING ATTRIBUTES
 
 ## MODEL OF THE PROJECT
 
 In My  work I tried to overcome some of disadvantage:

1. The training of our product isn’t as expensive as Training in other product. 
Our training is just description of electronic aid component and usage 
position. 
2. I use buzzer to transmit information to the Blind and integrated LCD 
in the hand, if they are deaf. It’s natural dimension to keep it user friendly.
3. It is very fast response time calculated as 39 ms in average of 400 cm 
before hitting the obstacles
4.I designed stick to detect obstacles and it’s able to Recognize and speak 
aloud the upward and downward stairs or puddles as shown in Fig.
