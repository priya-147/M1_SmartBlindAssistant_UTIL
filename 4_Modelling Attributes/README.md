# MODELLING ATTRIBUTES
## MODEL OF THE PROJECT:
 In our work we tried to overcome some of disadvantage:
* We designed stick to detect obstacles and it’s able to Recognize and speak 
aloud the upward and downward stairs or puddles as shown in Fig 
* The training of our product isn’t as expensive as Training in other product. 
Our training is just description of electronic aid component and usage 
position. 

* We use buzzer to transmit information to the Blind. We integrated LCD 
in the hand, if they are deaf. It’s natural dimension to keep it user friendly.
* It is very fast response time calculated as 39 ms in average of 400 cm 
before hitting the obstacles.

## CONCEPTIONAL DESIGN:
 The system will be designed to detect manhole and obstacle. It should 
be able to automatically calculate an approximate height of the user and average 
distance between the system in hand and surface. If at any time the distance between
the device and the surface is much higher than the average calculated distance then 
it will generate buzzer for manhole. The system will generate buzzer for obstacle if 
there is any obstacle within a certain range. If they are deaf, they must watch the 
distance displaying in the LCD. Then, they must add the resistor, potentiometer and 
transistor .With the help of this, they will display the distance in the LCD and if the 
obstacles is there, buzzer is generated.
