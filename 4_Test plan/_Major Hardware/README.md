## BUZZER:

   It is used to alert the blind people by giving the sound. Alarming Circuits, where 
the user has to be alarmed about something. Communicationequipments. 
Automobile electronics. Portable equipments, due to its compact size.

## ULTRASONIC SENSOR:

 Ultrasonic sensor work well for close obstacles unlike laser one, when 
an object is so close the laser sensor (less than 15 cm) can’t get an accurate reading. 
Moreover, it should be noted that radar sensors can easily detect near and far 
obstacles with equal perform once, but their medium accuracy doesn't allow them 
detecting small obstacles. Ultrasonic sensor used 40 kHz transmission signal. This 
is a reasonable size to be installed in the Aid. It is used to detect upward and downward stairs because the sensor spot is roughly 6 cm. This feature enables the 
user to identify precisely, any kind of stairs in front of him or her.

 An upper one at a height 90 cm to detect upper obstacles and another sensor at 
a height 30 cm to detect low obstacles. Detection using ultrasonic sensor is based 
on two factors: Time of flight (TOF) and Beam Size. Obstacles whose dimensions 
are larger than the beam size, all of the sound waves will be reflected to receiver.

## Bread Board:

A breadboard is used to build and test circuits quickly before finalizing any circuit
design. The breadboard has many holes into which circuit components like ICs and
resistors can be inserted. A typical breadboard is shown below:

It is important to breadboard a circuit neatly and systematically, so that one can debug it
and get it running easily and quickly. It also helps when someone else needs to
understand and inspect the circuit.

## LCD:

It is used to display the distance measured by ultrasonic sensor.
