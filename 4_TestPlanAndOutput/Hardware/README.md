# ULTRASONIC SENSOR

Ultrasonic sensor work well for close obstacles unlike laser one, when an object is so close the laser sensor (less than 15 cm) can’t get an accurate reading. Moreover, 
it should be noted that radar sensors can easily detect near and far obstacles with equal perform once, but their medium accuracy doesn't allow them detecting small obstacles. 
Ultrasonic sensor used 40 kHz transmission signal. This is a reasonable size to be installed in the Aid. It is used to detect upward and downward stairs because the sensor spot 
is roughly 6 cm. This feature enables the user to identify precisely, any kind of stairs in front of the person.

An upper one at a height 90 cm to detect upper obstacles and another sensor at a height 30 cm to detect low obstacles. Detection using ultrasonic sensor is based on two factors: 
Time of flight (TOF) and Beam Size. Obstacles whose dimensions are larger than the beam size, all of the sound waves will be reflected to receiver.

# BUZZER:
It is used to alert the blind people by giving the sound. Alarming Circuits, where the user has to be alarmed about something. Communication equipments,Automobile electronics,
Portable equipments, due to its compact size.

# BREAD BOARD:
A breadboard is used to build and test circuits quickly before finalizing any circuit design. The breadboard has many holes into which circuit components like
ICs and resistors can be inserted. A typical breadboard is shown below:

It is important to breadboard a circuit neatly and systematically, so that one can debug it and get it running easily and quickly. It also helps when someone else needs 
to understand and inspect the circuit.

# LCD:
It is used to display the distance measured by ultrasonic sensor.
