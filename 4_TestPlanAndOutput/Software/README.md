The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), analog inputs, 
a 16MHZ ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; 
simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with an adapter or battery to get started.

# POWER:

* The Arduino UNO can be powered via the USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically.
* External power can come either from AC to DC adapter or battery.
* Leads from a battery can be inserted in the GND and Vin pin headers of the power connector.
* The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than 5V and the board may be unstable. 
if using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.
* The power pins are as follows:

# VIN:
The input voltage to the Arduino board .It can supply voltage either using an external power source or via the power jack.
# 5V:
This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7-12V), the USB connector (5V).
# 3.3V:
  * A 3.3 volts supply generated by the regulator. Maximum current draw   is 50mA. And Ground pins.
  * Each of the 14 digital pins (pin 0 to 13) can provide the UNO can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They 
operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive maximum of 40mA and has an internal pull-up resistor of 20-50 kOhms.
