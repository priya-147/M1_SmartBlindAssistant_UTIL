 ## INTRODUCTION
 
  This project are  about the obstacles presence in a road, active 
or passive sensors can be used. In case of a passive sensor, the sensor just receives 
a signal. It detects the reflected, emitted or transmitted electro-magnetic radiation 
provided by natural energy sources. In case of using an active sensor, the sensor 
emits a signal and receives a distorted version of the reflected signal. It detects 
reflected responses from objects irradiated with artificially generated energy 
sources. These kind of active sensors are capable of sensing and detecting far and 
near obstacles. In addition, it determines an accurate measurement of the distance 
between the blind and the obstacle. Overall, in the obstacle detection domain, four 
different types of active sensors may be used: infrared, laser, ultrasonic, in addition 
to radar sensors. 
## Uses of Materials

 Smart Cane, Smart vision, Guide Cane, use ultrasonic sensors or 
laser sensors to detect obstacles in front of blind by transmitting the wave 
and reception of reflected waves. It produces either an audio or vibration in 
response to detected obstacles to warn blind. Systems voice use single camera or 
stereo video cameras mounted on a wearable device to capture images. These 
captured images are re-sized, processed further and converted to speech, audio, 
musical sounds or vibrations. In such systems, the frequency of warning sound 
signal is correlated with the orientation of pixels. Some advanced systems use 
Global Positioning System (GPS) integration with the mainsystem. It's also 
noteworthy that GPS receiver is useful for understanding the current location of the 
subject and nearby landmarks.

## Future Scope

In Future, it must provide an efficient navigation aid for visually impaired people with the help of Arduino UNO board, ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer. This developed system can able to detect especially five obstacles such as pavement up, pavement down, pit, lamp post and trees. It uses buzzer system to aware the subject about the detected objects.
The Blind System hopes to allow visually impaired users to be aware about the objects in the front. The system hopes to provide a portable unit that can easily be carried and operated by a visually impaired user.

## Conclusion

This Project provides a new concept of smart electronic aid for blind people. The project lies in the fact that it can prove to be very low cost solution to millions of blind people worldwide. The proposed combination of various working units makes a real-time system that monitors position of the user and provides feedback making navigation more safe and secure.It is effective and afford. It leads to good results in detecting the obstacles lying ahead of the user in a range of four meters, detecting stairs and water pits. This system offers a low- cost, reliable, portable, low-power consumption and robust solution for navigation with obvious short response time.
