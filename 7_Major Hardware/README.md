#  ULTRASONIC SENSOR:
 Ultrasonic sensor work well for close obstacles unlike laser one, when 
an object is so close the laser sensor (less than 15 cm) can’t get an accurate reading. 
Moreover, it should be noted that radar sensors can easily detect near and far 
obstacles with equal perform once, but their medium accuracy doesn't allow them 
detecting small obstacles. Ultrasonic sensor used 40 kHz transmission signal. This 
is a reasonable size to be installed in the Aid. It is used to detect upward and downward stairs because the sensor spot is roughly 6 cm.This feature enables the 
user to identify precisely, any kind of stairs in front of him.

An upper one at a height 90 cm to detect upper obstacles and another sensor at 
a height 30 cm to detect low obstacles. Detection using ultrasonic sensor is based 
on two factors: Time of flight (TOF) and Beam Size. Obstacles whose dimensions 
are larger than the beam size, all of the sound waves will be reflected to receiver.

#  BUZZER:
 It is used to alert the blind people by giving the sound. Alarming Circuits, where 
the user has to be alarmed about something. Communicationequipments. 
Automobile electronics. Portable equipments, due to its compact size.

#  LCD:
 It is used to display the distance measured by ultrasonic sensor.
