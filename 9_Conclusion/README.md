##  CONCLUSION

 The paper provides a new concept of smart electronic aid for blind 
people. The advantage of this project lies in the fact that it can prove to be very 
low cost solution to millions of blind people worldwide. The proposed 
combination of various working units makes a real-time system that monitors 
position of the user and provides feedback making navigation more safe and 
secure.


 The Smart Aid acts as a basic platform for the coming generation of 
more aiding devices to help the visually impaired to be more safe. It is effective 
and afford. It leads to good results in detecting the obstacles lying ahead of the user 
in a range of four meters, detecting stairs and water pits. This system offers a low-cost, reliable, portable, low-power consumption and robust solution for navigation 
with obvious short response time. Though the system is hard-wired with sensors 
and other components, it's light in weight. Further aspects of this system can be 
improved via wireless connectivity between the system components, thus, 
increasing the range of the ultrasonic sensor and implementing a technology 
for determining the speed of approaching obstacles. While developing such an 
empowering solution, visually impaired and blind people in all developing 
countries were on top of our priorities.

 ##  FUTURE SCOPE:
 
 
 In Future, it must provide an efficient navigation aid for visually impaired 
people with the help of Arduino UNO board, ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer. This 
developed system can able to detect especially five obstacles such as pavement up, 
pavement down, pit, lamp post and trees. It uses buzzer system to aware the subject 
about the detected objects.
The Blind System hopes to allow visually impaired users to be aware about the 
objects in the front. The system hopes to provide a portable unit that can easily be 
carried and operated by a visually impaired user.
