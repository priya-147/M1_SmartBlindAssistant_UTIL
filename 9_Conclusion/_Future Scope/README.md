## FUTURE SCOPE:

 In Future, it must provide an efficient navigation aid for visually impaired 
people with the help of Arduino UNO board, ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer. This 
developed system can able to detect especially five obstacles such as pavement up, 
pavement down, pit, lamp post and trees. It uses buzzer system to aware the subject 
about the detected objects.
 The Blind System hopes to allow visually impaired users to be aware about the 
objects in the front. The system hopes to provide a portable unit that can easily be 
carried and operated by a visually impaired user.
